/**
 * Domain layer - Core business logic and rules.
 * 
 * This layer is completely independent of frameworks and infrastructure.
 * Contains only pure business logic with no technical dependencies.
 * 
 * Key principles:
 * - No Spring annotations (except compile-time like Lombok)
 * - No infrastructure imports
 * - Business rules enforced through domain services
 * - Rich domain models with behavior
